###  <b> About me:</b><br>
  
  Well, mostly it's a pleasure to meet you! I am a Data Scientist at IBM (International Business Machines), with the main objective of working and improving my knowledge at the vast world of Data, something that has been the focus of my studies.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on IBM (International Business Machine), beeing a Data Scientist, helping my clients with Data Analysis and Machine Learning models in general;
- 📚 My main focus right now is to improve my knowledge in Machine and Deep Learning. I'm studying the part of neural networks with great focus at the moment;
- 🎵 The type of song that I mostly listen while working is Lofi (I love lofi!); 
- 🙂 Fun fact: 🏋️ I love to go to the gym and lift some weightsss! 🏋️
